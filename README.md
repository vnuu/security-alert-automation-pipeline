# Security Alert Automation Pipeline

**A complete, end-to-end SOC alert triage pipeline that integrates Windows 10 telemetry (via Sysmon) with cloud-hosted SIEM, SOAR, and case management platforms to automate Mimikatz alert detection, enrichment, and escalation.**

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Windows 10 VM** with Sysmon
- **Wazuh** (SIEM)
- **Shuffle** (SOAR automation)
- **TheHive** (Case management)
- **VirusTotal API** (Reputation checking)

---

## Objectives

**The goal of this project is to design and implement a fully automated SOC alert triage pipeline that integrates endpoint telemetry (via Sysmon) with a cloud-hosted SIEM (Wazuh), SOAR automation (Shuffle), and case management (TheHive) platforms. The pipeline automates the detection, enrichment, and escalation of Mimikatz alerts in a controlled environment, simulating real-world attack scenarios.**

---

## Architecture Diagram

**This project uses Wazuh, TheHive, and Shuffle to automate threat detection and response. Logs from a Windows 10 machine are sent to the Wazuh Manager, which triggers alerts. These alerts are processed by Shuffle, which enriches the data, sends it to TheHive to create cases, and notifies the SOC analyst by email. Based on the analysis, Shuffle or the analyst can take response actions. The setup helps simulate a basic SOC workflow with automated detection, alerting, and response.**

## Application and VM Setup

**In this phase, virtual machines were provisioned to host the core components of the SOC automation stack. This included setting up separate VMs for the Wazuh SIEM server and TheHive incident response platform. Supporting software and dependencies were also installed to ensure all components could run smoothly in an isolated lab environment.**

### 1. Windows 10 VM 

VirtualBox is used as the hypervisor to run the Windows VM locally.

- [VirtualBox Download](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- VirtualBox Version: `7.x`
- Extension Pack: Installed (for additional features like clipboard sharing and USB passthrough)

To simulate real-world attacker and endpoint behavior, a dedicated Windows 10 virtual machine (VM) was created. This endpoint serves as the telemetry source in the lab, designed to generate logs and security events for collection, detection, and triage via Wazuh and TheHive.

**Virtual Machine Settings**

| Setting        | Value             |
|----------------|------------------|
| VM Name        | `WIN10-ENDPOINT` |
| OS Type        | Windows 10 (64-bit) |
| Memory         | 8 GB              |
| vCPUs          | 2                 |
| Disk Size      | 50 GB (Dynamic)   |
| Network        | NAT + Host-Only   |

**Sysmon**

**Sysmon is installed to generate detailed Windows event logs like process creation, network connections, and file changes. In this project, it's used to capture security events when Mimikatz is run, so Wazuh can detect it and automate responses through TheHive and Shuffle.**

1. Download Sysmon from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon
2. Click on the **Download Sysmon** link to download a ZIP file.
3. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a folder, for example: `C:\Tools\Sysmon`
4. The extracted files should include:
     - `Sysmon.exe` (32-bit)
     - `Sysmon64.exe` (64-bit)
     - License agreement text file

**Sysmon Configuration File**

1. Head to https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular
2. Open the repository and locate the file `sysmonconfig.xml`
3. Click the file, then click the **Raw** button
4. Right-click anywhere on the page and choose **Save As**
5. Save the file as `sysmonconfig.xml` in your Sysmon folder, e.g., `C:\Downloads\Sysmon`

- **The Sysmon folder should look like this:**

### 2. Wazuh and TheHive

**In this part of the project, two virtual machines (VMs) were set up in DigitalOcean to host Wazuh (for SIEM) and TheHive (for case management). These VMs are configured to communicate with each other securely with only the necessary ports open through firewall rules.**

### Wazuh and TheHive VM Setup

1. Sign up for a DigitalOcean account.

2. Create New Droplets (VMs)
- Go to your DigitalOcean dashboard and click on **Create** â†’ **Droplets**.
- Choose an image (for both VMs, select Ubuntu 22.04 (LTS) x64 as the base image).
- Select a plan.
- Set up authentication (either SSH keys or password).
- Click on **Create Droplet**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b1aec42-5728-4b3e-bb04-52a4cf40f3f1)


3. Configure Firewall
Once the VMs are created, navigate to **Networking** in the DigitalOcean dashboard and set up firewall rules to ensure that only necessary ports are accessible for both VMs.

**Inbound Rules:**
Allow only your IP address to access all necessary ports over both TCP and UDP protocols. This restricts unauthorized access while enabling full control from your machine.

- **Protocol**: TCP & UDP  
- **Port Range**: All  
- **Source**: Your IP address (e.g., your home or office public IP)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42e39223-e9ca-43e4-87ea-465141d51374)


**Outbound Rules:**
Permit full outbound access to enable the VMs to reach external services.

- **ICMP**: All destinations (for ping and diagnostics)  
- **TCP/UDP**: All ports to all IPv4 and IPv6 destinations

## Wazuh and TheHive Configuration

**Wazuh was configured as the SIEM solution to detect potential security events based on predefined rules. TheHive was set up to receive alerts from Wazuh via webhooks. This integration ensures that once Wazuh detects suspicious activity, a case is automatically created in TheHive for further analysis and incident management.**

### TheHive 5 Configuration

After installing TheHive, perform the following steps to configure it properly and ensure it's ready to receive alerts and integrate with other tools like Wazuh or Cortex.

**Cassandra Configuration**

1. Locate Cassandra's configuration file
```bash
nano /etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml
```

2. Configure `cluster_name`
```bash
cluster_name: 'vnu'
```
**Replace 'vnu' with your desired cluster name to ensure it matches the Cassandra cluster configuration.**

3. Set listen_address and `rpc_address` as the public IP of TheHive
- Listen Address:
```bash
listen_address: 209.97.173.238
```

- RPC Address:
```bash
rpc_address: 209.97.173.238
```

4. Configure seed provider
```bash
seeds: "209.97.173.238:7000"
```

5. Save configuration and stop the Cassandra service
```bash
systemctl stop cassandra.service
```

6. Remove old Cassandra files
```bash
rm -rf /var/lib/cassandra/*
```

7. Start Cassandra service
```bash
systemctl start cassandra.service
```

8. Ensure Cassandra service is running
```bash
systemctl status cassandra.service
```

**Elasticsearch Configuration**

1. Locate Elasticsearch's main configuration file
```bash
nano /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
```

2. Configure `cluster.name`

```

4. Configure `network.host`
```bash
network.host: 209.97.173.238
```

5. Configure `cluster.initial_master_nodes`

(To start Elasticsearch, you must configure either a discovery seed host or specify an initial master node. For this project, the cluster.initial_master_nodes setting is used to define the initial master node.)
```bash
cluster.initial_master_nodes: ["node-1"]
```

6. Save configuration and start Elasticsearch service
```bash
systemctl start elasticsearch
```

7. Enable Elasticsearch service
```bash
systemctl enable elasticsearch
```

8. Ensure Elasticsearch service is running

## Telemetry Generation and Ingestion

**In this part, simulated attack activities were carried out on the Windows 10 virtual machine to produce telemetry data. **Mimikatz** is used to mimic credential theft techniques often seen in real-world attacks. The purpose was to evaluate Wazuhâ€™s detection capabilities by observing how it reacts to suspicious behavior. The Windows VM was configured to forward logs to the Wazuh manager. Wazuhâ€™s built-in ruleset was used to identify malicious patterns in the logs. Once the logs were ingested, alerts were generated and made available for further processing and correlation with TheHive.**

### Sysmon Log Ingestion

1. On the Windows 10 VM, locate the `ossec.conf` file
```file
C:\Program Files(x86)\ossec-agent
```
2. For good measure, create a backup of the `ossec.conf` file
3. Configure the `ossec.conf` file to allow it to ingest Sysmon logs:
```text
<localfile>
   <location>Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational</location>
   <log_format>eventchannel</log_format>
</localfile>
```
4. Save the configuration and restart the Wazuh service.
5. Head to the Wazuh Dashboard and check for Sysmon events. (Note: It may take some time for the Sysmon events to load.)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba427250-86be-45d8-894e-46a858f53535)

### Wazuh Manager Log Ingestion Configuration

1. In Wazuh Manager, ensure that a backup of `ossec.conf` is made
```bash
cp /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf ~/ossec-backup.conf
```

2. In `ossec.conf`, set the following parameters to `yes`
```nano
<logall>yes</logall>
<logall_json>yes</logall_json>
```

3. Save the configuration and restart the Wazuh Manager service.
4. Check for the archived logs called `archives.json` and `archives.log`:
```bash
cd /var/ossec/logs/archives/
```

4. Open the `filebeat.yml` file to configure Wazuh to ingest these logs.
```bash
nano /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml
```

5. In the `filebeat.modules` section, set the `archives` parameter to `true`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/848068a9-51ab-4755-8a68-a398585f00c4)

6. Save the configuration and restart the Filebeat service.

### Wazuh Index Creation

1. On the Wazuh Dashboard, under the "Management" section in the sidebar menu, click on "Stack Management" and then select "Index Patterns".
2. Create an index pattern and name it as `wazuh-archives-**`.
3. Select `timestamp` for the time field and click on the `Create index pattern` button.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87bc2357-6d8f-48ef-9067-c926abbde990)

4. Head to "Discover" and change the index pattern to the archives to view the events.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45b889ee-7a6f-4878-9f06-fe999b647df9)


### Mimikatz Installation and Testing

1. On the Windows 10 VM, download and extract [Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/releases/tag/2.2.0-20220919).
2. Run Powershell as Administrator and run Mimikatz.
- Head to Mimikatz installed directory.
- Run `Mimikatz.exe`.

![mimkatzexe](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/048beaba-fd23-4faf-830c-d0c38e14f76c)

3. In Discover, query for Mimikatz in the search bar. Mimikatz event logs should now be shown. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51ae2604-c8a9-4e50-b3c3-17ab851ee1e7)

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- Try running Mimikatz a few times
- It might take a while for events to start flowing in. To troubleshoot this, you can `cat` the `archives.log` file in Wazuh Manager and `grep` for "mimikatz" and check to see if the logs are being generated or not.
```bash
cat /var/ossec/logs/archives/archives.log | grep -i mimikatz
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2838ef99-de58-4096-beee-5d3c39530fe8)

- If Mimikatz is still not showing in Wazuh but its appearing in `archives.log`, try forcing ingestion by restarting the Wazuh Manager service **(NOTE: Only do this in a demo environment, not in production)**


### Rule Creation

1. On the homepage, select Management, then under Administration, click on Rules.
2. Click on Manage Rule Files at the top right corner.
3. Click on Custom Rules.
4. Click on the edit icon for `local_rules.xml`.
5. Add a custom rule for Mimikatz:
- Start by creating a `<rule>` tag and assign a unique `id`. Avoid using IDs that are already in use â€” custom rules often start from 100000 onwards.
- Set the `level` to define the severity of the event.  
- Inside the rule, use `<if_group>` to specify the group of logs it applies to. In this case, it would be `sysmon_event1`.
- Add a `<field>` to specify the condition. Use the `win.eventdata.originalFileName` field and a case-insensitive regular expression `(pcre2)` to match `mimikatz.exe`. ( `win.eventdata.originalFileName` is used because it reflects the original name of the binary, which stays the same even if the attacker renames the file.)
- Write a short and clear `<description>` to indicate what the rule detects â€” for example, "Mimikatz usage detected".
- Add a `<mitre>` tag and include the relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique ID â€” for Mimikatz, this is T1003 (Credential Dumping).
- Ensure the rule block is structured and indented properly.
- The rule block for Mimikatz should look like this:
```xml
 <rule id="100002" level="15">
    <if_group>sysmon_event1</if_group>
    <field name="win.eventdata.originalFileName" type="pcre2">(?i)mimikatz\.exe</field>
    <description>Mimikatz usage detected</description>
    <mitre>
      <id>T1003</id>
    </mitre>
 </rule>
```
6. Save the XML file and restart the Wazuh Manager when prompted.
7. Rerun `Mimikatz.exe` on the Windows 10 VM and refresh the Wazuh Dashboard.
8. The Mimikatz alert should now been shown in the Security Events section:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/152e5330-b031-4b61-8f8a-217401ef950b)


## SOAR Integration & Alert Automation

Shuffle, an open-source SOAR tool, was integrated into the environment to automate alert handling. When Wazuh detects an alert, it is forwarded to TheHive via Shuffle. An automated workflow was created to send email notifications to a designated SOC analyst.

**Shuffle Setup**

1. Create a [Shuffle](https://shuffler.io/) account.
2. Create a Workflow.
3.
