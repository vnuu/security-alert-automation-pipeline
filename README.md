# SOC Alert Automation Pipeline

A complete, end-to-end SOC alert triage pipeline that integrates Windows 10 telemetry (via Sysmon) with cloud-hosted SIEM, SOAR, and case management platforms to automate Mimikatz alert detection, enrichment, and escalation.

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Windows 10 VM** with Sysmon
- **Wazuh** (SIEM)
- **Shuffle** (SOAR automation)
- **TheHive** (Case management)
- **VirusTotal API** (Reputation checking)

---

## Installation

### 1. Endpoint Preparation (Windows 10 VM)

To simulate real-world attacker and endpoint behavior, a dedicated Windows 10 virtual machine (VM) was provisioned. This endpoint serves as the telemetry source in the lab, designed to generate logs and security events for collection, detection, and triage via Wazuh and TheHive.

**VirtualBox** is a free and open-source virtualization tool that enables you to create and run virtual machines on your computer. It is used to run the Windows 10 VM, which will act as the endpoint.

#### 1.1 Install VirtualBox
1. Download and install **VirtualBox** from [VirtualBox Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
2. Follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

#### 1.2 Create a New Windows 10 Virtual Machine
1. Open **VirtualBox** and click **New** to start creating a new VM.
2. Name the VM (e.g., "Windows10") and select **Windows 10** as the operating system version.
3. Allocate **4GB of RAM** (minimum) and **20GB of disk space** (recommended: 8GB RAM, 50GB disk).
4. Select **Create a virtual hard disk now** and choose **VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)** format with **Dynamically allocated** storage.
5. Click **Create** to finalize the VM creation.
6. Select the Windows 10 Virtual Machine and click **Start** to run the VM.

#### 1.3 Download Sysmon

**Sysmon** is installed to generate detailed Windows event logs like process creation, network connections, and file changes. In this project, it's used to capture security events when Mimikatz is run, so Wazuh can detect it and automate responses through TheHive and Shuffle.

1. Download Sysmon from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon
2. Click on the **Download Sysmon** link to download a ZIP file.
3. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a folder, for example: `C:\Tools\Sysmon`
4. The extracted files should include:
     - `Sysmon.exe` (32-bit)
     - `Sysmon64.exe` (64-bit)
     - License agreement text file

#### 1.4 Download Sysmon Configuration File

1. Head to https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular
2. Open the repository and locate the file `sysmonconfig.xml`
3. Click the file, then click the **Raw** button
4. Right-click anywhere on the page and choose **Save As**
5. Save the file as `sysmonconfig.xml` in your Sysmon folder, e.g., `C:\Downloads\Sysmon`

- **The Sysmon folder should look like this:**

#### 1.5 Running Sysmon via Powershell

1. Open Powershell as Administrator
2. In Powershell, navigate to the folder where Sysmon was located
```powershell
   cd "C:\Downloads\Sysmon"
```
3. Run Sysmon with the Configuration File
```powershell
   .\Sysmon64.exe -i sysmonconfig.xml
```

4. Verify that Sysmon is Running
```powershell
   Get-Service Sysmon64
```

5. Verify Sysmon logs in Event Viewer

- Go to:
```Settings
   Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Sysmon > Operational
```

### 2. Setting Up Wazuh and TheHive Virtual Machines

In this project, two VMs were created and hosted in the cloud using DigitalOcean, one for Wazuh and one for TheHive. A firewall was applied to each Droplet, allowing only the necessary ports to access the VMs.

#### 2.1 Setting Up Droplets in DigitalOcean

1. Head to https://www.digitalocean.com/ and sign up for an account.
